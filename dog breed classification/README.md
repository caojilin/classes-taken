### [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification)

the idea is same as cifar-10. Using a pre-trained ImageNet model with high performance. A better approach would be first extract featurs and store them as NdArray. Then use a fully connected Neural Network with a hidden layer to classify these features, as we believe those extracted features can represent those original images. Then we put our faith in the power of fully connected neural network.
